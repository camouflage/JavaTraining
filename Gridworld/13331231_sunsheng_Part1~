1. No. When there is a barrier in front of the bug, it changes its direction, not moving to a new location; otherwise, it stays moving forward to a new location.
2. The bug moves clockwise.
3. If the bug does not move, it turns right by 45 degree.
4. A series of flowers in the same color as the bug.
5. When the bug is at the edge, it turns right by 45 degree(e.g. Facing north, the bug will turn to face northeast; facing northeast, the bug will turn to face east etc). However, if the grid is unbounded, the bug will move out of the grid.
6. The bug tries to avoid the rock by turning right by 45 degree.
7. Flowers do not move.
8. With time going by, flowers become dark(e.g. from red, to pink, to purple, and finally to black).
